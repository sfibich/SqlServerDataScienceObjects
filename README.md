# SqlServerDataScienceObjects
Data Science functions coded in native SQL Server Objects

This project is an experiment to see if I can use my limited knowledge to code function useful in data science activities as native
SQL Server Objects.  The hope if to provide in database objects that do not need to move data out of the database to execute on them.
With any luck the objects will be fast to execute as well.  


We will see!
